Description: Functions to calculate Unique Trait Combinations (UTC) and scaled
    Unique Trait Combinations (sUTC) as measures of multivariate richness. The
    package can also calculate beta-diversity for trait richness and can
    partition this into nestedness-related and turnover components. The code
    will also calculate several measures of overlap.
